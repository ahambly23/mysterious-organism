# mysterious-organism

Context: You’re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. Your team names the organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for your research team to study.

As you progress through the steps, use the terminal and console.log() statements to check the output of your loops and functions.


If you’d like to challenge yourself further, you could consider the following:

Create a .complementStrand() method to the factory function’s object that returns the complementary DNA strand. The rules are that 'A's match with 'T's and vice versa. Also, 'C's match with 'G's and vice versa. (Check the hint for more details)

Use the .compareDNA() to find the two most related instances of pAequor.
